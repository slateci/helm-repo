The following outlines the basic format for the READMEs that should be in the folder for all stable applications in the slate catalog, written in githubâ€™s markup language.


#<Application name>

Put a short blurb explaining what this specific application is for other slate users who may not be familiar with the application.

#Installation

The actual format in this section can vary depending on the complexity of the installation for your specific application. It should at the bare minimum include the slate console commands needed to install the application. Also any extra steps and dependencies that come with your application should be found in this section, and split into subsections formatted as found below
###<subsection 1>
###<subsection 2>

#Configuration and usage

This section can very in format similarly to the above Installation section, but it should contain any special configuration options and any usage instructions for the application. Once again it should be split into subsections as above. This is also a very good place to provide a link to the documentation of the application.
